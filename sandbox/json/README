The JSON describes forms in terms of segments. Segments may contain multiple segments. The
entire form comprises one segment that represents the root of the form. 

Here is a truncated version of the JSON form:

// This defines the entire form as a segment, which contains other segments.
// The form has dimensions 2550x330.
{"name":"village_reach_form", "width":2550, "height":3300, "dataType":"segment", "segments":[
    // One segment of the form encapsulating all data to do with the disease "BCG"
    // This segment is surrounded in a rectangle, defined by the given width and height in pixels.
    // The top left corner of the form is relative to the entire form.
    {"name":"BCG", "x":230, "y":750, "width":1900, "height":200, "dataType":"segment", "segments":[
        // This is a segment that contains bubbles. 
        // The top left corner of this segment is relative to the entire form.
        {"name":"zero_to_eleven_years", "x":415, "y":750, "width":850, "height":200, "dataType":"segment", "segments":[
            // This is a list of bubble positions within the segment given above.
            // The position of each bubble is relative to the top left corner of the
            // surrounding segment.
            { "name":"bubbles","dataType":"bubble_block",
                "bubbles": [20, 40, 60, 40, 100, 40]
            }
        ]},
        // Another segment within the BCG segment.
        {"name":"twelve_to_twenty_three_years", "x":1410, "y":750, "width":290, "height":200, "dataType":"segment", "segments":[
            // Bubbles within this segment.
            // Note that the position of bubbles within the segment are the same positions 
            // listed in the last bubble block. Remember: bubble positions are relative
            // to their parent segment so these bubbles represent different bubbles in the form
            // than the last bubble block.
            { "name":"bubbles","dataType":"bubble_block",
                "bubbles": [20, 40, 60, 40, 100, 40]
            }
        ]}
    ]}]
}

The outermost object represents the whole form. It is a segment named
"village_reach_segment." It has a width and height of 2550 and 3300, respectively.
The width and height represent the dimensions of the entire form. The form consists
of a list of segments. In this example the entire form has 

The second segment, "BCG," is within the form to define a human-sensible area of the form.
This segment of the form defines an area of the form image that contextualizes data within
the segment. Segments like this should include enough of the form to identify the segment
within the rest of the form. This segment contains a width and a height and x and y coordinates.
The x and y coordinates
