This is a testing suite for the form scanning procedure.
You will need to provide your own form images in a "form_images" folder.

Source file information
______________________________

	Core Files:

* Processor - 		Handles JSON parsing and provides an interface.
* FormAlignment - 	Contains functions for aligning forms and segments.
* PCA_classifier - 	Classifies bubbles using principal component analysis.
					Contains code for reading training data from directories and refining bubble positions.
* Addons - 			Misc. utility functions that are useful in multiple places.
* NameGenerator - 	A utility for generating unique names.
* FileUtils - 		A utility for crawling file tree and returning all the file names.
* MarkupForm - 		Contains a function for marking up a form using a JSON form template or bubble vals file.

	note:
	Core Files can be swapped with those in the jni directory.
	The command "make jni-transfer" will do this swapping for you.

	Test Suite Specific Files:
	
* TestTools - 		Code for use in test programs. Prints out stats.
* ROC_plot_script - Plots ROC curves using the resultant data from tests with varying parameters.
					In order to generate plots you will have to install [R] the statisical programming language.

The tests folder contains the actual test code.
Each cpp file in there should have a make corresponding make target you can use.
If you should decide to modify any of that code with changes to I/O it's important to note that it all gets run from the TestSuite directory.
More to come as the suite develops...
